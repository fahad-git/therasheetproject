## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment.
- **npm:** Node package manager, typically installed alongside Node.js.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fahad-git/therasheetproject.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd therasheetproject
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **`npm start`:** Runs the app in development mode. Open `http://localhost:3000` to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.
- **`npm test`:** Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- **`npm run build`:** Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
- **`npm run eject`:** Removes the single build dependency from your project. **Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!
